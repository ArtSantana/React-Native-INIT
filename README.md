# React Native Script Structure

That script was a way that i found to optimize my time, here the script create the folder structures like: assets, components, hooks, locales, models, pages,  routes, services, store, styles, utils. And the base for React Navigation, Redux, Redux Saga and Styled-components Theme.


### We install using yarn the respectives dependencies:

- react-native-vector-icons
- react-redux
- redux
- redux-saga
- redux-persist
- react-native-responsive-screen
- @react-native-community/async-storage
- @react-navigation/native
- react-native-reanimated
- react-native-gesture-handler
- react-native-screens
- react-native-safe-area-context
- @react-native-community/masked-view
- @react-navigation/stack
- @reduxjs/toolkit
- styled-components

### In dev

- @types/react 
- @types/react-native 
- @types/react-native-vector-icons 
- @types/react-redux 
- @types/styled-components 
- @types/styled-components-react-native 
- babel-plugin-module-resolver 
- typescript 
- @types/jest 
- @types/react-test-renderer 
- react-addons-test-utils

But the script does not configure the gradle and pods.

Setting up the script

```bash
 git clone https://github.com/ArtSantana/React-Native-Script-Structure
 cd React-Native-INIT
 sudo cp rninit /usr/bin
```
